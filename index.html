    <h1>I had a hard time unziping the smaple file. </h1>
    <p>c9 couldn't recognize it because the their was a space in the file name. My husband solved the problem by renaming it samplefile.zip. </p>
    <h2>Then it worked!</h2>
    <p>Today I learned that I can use a backslash after the first word before the space to open the file, like this sample\ files.zip.</p>
